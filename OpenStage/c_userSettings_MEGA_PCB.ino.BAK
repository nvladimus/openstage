// Some global definitions that need to be modified by the user for the stage to work

// This file is set up for three axes, an LCD display, and a game pad. This requires a 
// Mega as a lot of pins are used.

// * Enable/disable major OpenStage functions 
//
#define DO_LCD      //Uncomment this line to enable enable LCD character display
#define DO_GAMEPAD  //Uncomment this line to enable PS3 DualShock as an input device
#define PCB         //This is uncommented if the user has an OpenStage PCB

// * Serial communications
//
// You have three options for serial comms: 
// 1) Control stage via PC serial port and receive optional debug information via USB (virtual 
//    serial port). The latter is available by the verbose option in some of the functions. 
// 2) Control stage via USB (virtual serial) but receive no debug info. 
// 3) Disable serial comms for stage control. 
//
// These three possibilities are controlled by altering the following two variables:
#define DO_SERIAL_INTERFACE //Uncomment to enable serial interface
bool controlViaUSB=0;       //Set to 1 to control via USB.

//If using PC serial port, this is the ID of the MEGA's hardware serial line (e.g. Serial3)
//If using an Uno, or another mic with no hardware serial, then this should be set to "Serial"
#define HARDWARE_SERIAL_PORT Serial3
HardwareSerial* SerialComms;  //pointer to stage comms serial object

//The following is not a user setting 
#ifdef DO_SERIAL_INTERFACE
 bool doSerialInterface=1; //Do not alter this value 
#endif

// are simply not read.

// fullStep
// Stepper motor full step size (in degrees) for X,Y,Z. We have tested 1.8 degree and 0.9
// degree step sizes. Motors with finer step sizes are available but driving them in

// in the shortest time, 0.9 degree motors are suggested.

// disableWhenStationary
// bool to tell the system whether or not a motor should be disabled when the stage isn't moving.

// power is switched off. Perhaps it makes make sense to do this in X and Y but not Z.

// PS3 Controller speed settings
// The following settings define how the PS3 controller will control the stage. If you don't have a
// PS3 controller, you can ignore the following 

// * Speed modes (hat-stick)
//
// There will be four (coarse to fine) speeds which may be selected via the two shoulder buttons 
// (L1 and R1). The currently selected speed will be inidicated by the 4 LEDs on the DualShock.
// 1 is fine and slow and 4 is coarse and fast. Here we define the step size and max speed for those
// 4 speed settings. If you change these, you should verify with an osciloscope and the serial 
// monitor that the right values are being produced. You will also need to verify that you are not
// over-driving you motor and causing it to miss steps. Missing steps means the controller will lose
// its absolute position (there is no feedback from the motors). Note that the selection of speed
// values and step sizes are chosen based on the resulting step frequencies the controller must 
// produce and on resonances the motors might exhibit.   
unsigned short maxSpeed[4]={3.5,25,100,750}; //defined in microns per second


// stepSize
// The microstep sizes for each speed mode.
float stepSize[4]={1/16.0, 1/8.0, 1/4.0, 1/2.0}; //Defined in fractions of a full step

// * Speed mode (D-pad)
//
// The D-pad will be used for making fixed-distance motions of a high speed. The size of the motions
// depends on the coarseFine setting and is defined by the DPadStep array. There's a trade-off between
// speed and accuracy. For these fast motions, I'd like to be hit about 1000 um/s but the AccelStepper 
// moveTo function can only churn out about 4.3 kHz on an Arduino Mega. At 1/4 steps we get reliable
// motions and about 700 um/s. A 1/4 step gives us a 0.156 micron resolution in Z (0.9 degree stepper 
// and 250 um per rev micrometer). The motors MUST be enabled throughout or they will slip and become
// hopelessly lost. To get increased accuracy *and* higher speeds we would need a faster micro-controller,
// or write our own hardware-timer based routines, or slave comercial controllers.

float DPadStepSize=1/2.0;
// Acceleration in X, Y, and Z
unsigned long DPadAccel[maxAxes]={1.0E4, 1.0E4, 1.0E4, 1.0E4};


// * moveTo speeds
//
// The moveToTarget() function is executed when the user travels to a right-button set point
// or responds to a serial command. It does this using the settings described below. The minimum
// step size and motor RPM are reported to the serial terminal on bootup. Keep speeds below
// stalling value. Also, remember that the AccelStepper library won't produce pulse rates above
// about 4 kHz.
float moveToStepSize=1.0/2.0;
unsigned int moveToSpeed[maxAxes]={1600,1600,1200,1600}; 
unsigned int moveToAccel[maxAxes]={1.0E4,1.0E4,1.0E4,1.0E4};

// to invert hat-stick motion direction set to -1, otherwise set to 1.

byte coarseFine=2; //boot up in a fine mode
short hatStickThresh=40; //Ensure we don't get motion for stick values smaller than the following threshold

// curve
// Curve is the non-linear mapping value to convert analog stick position to speed. The idea
// is to make the conversion from analog stick value to motor pulse rate logarithmic. 
// 0 is linear. See the fscale function for details.
